# Leetcode Solutions

### Not active now, doing [algoexpert](https://github.com/0xaf2f6ad/algoexpert) instead

This is the repo of all of my leetcode solutions. Primarily I have been solving every problem in c++, but gettting into learning rust so also slowly translating each problem to rust.

Trying to get consistent and solve a problem a day, hopefully documenting on github actually helps with it :^]
